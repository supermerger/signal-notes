I am constantly testing everything to see whether it stands up to my internal stress testing. This comes from my major mode of [detachment](detachment.md).

Writing stories is a great way to stress test.
[world building](world%20building.md) is an exercise in stress testing. Can you build a world with 80% [coherence](coherence.md)?
