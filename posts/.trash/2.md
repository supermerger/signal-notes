I should be mindful that writing here in a blog that nobody will really read stops one important side of online writing -- feedback loops. It's hard to know whether or not something resonates with anyone if you are forever shouting into the void. The exercise at the moment however is just getting used to the habit of writing and publishing. The exercise is just to remove the friction between writing and getting things out there. Perhaps it is cowardly to do it this way and almost avoid eyes.

I feel that my life could have been different if I'd searched out more contemporaries to work alongside. I always wanted to do things my own way, to isolate myself. There was no-one to keep me honest and keep me on-track. Things are easy to dodge when there is no one there to keep you on the path. Dodging is something people do to get out of doing something. The intellect will always be there to invent a path away from something unpleasant. It can be relied upon to do that. 

Pedantry is the curse of my life. The way that I dodge things is by getting caught up in small details. I work on tiny parts of a whole and neglect the parts that mean delivery. I notice this pattern in my life again and again. Sometimes the details are important, but more important is getting things done and getting things out. Shipping things is part of the feedback loop.
