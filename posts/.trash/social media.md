"I wish I had thoughts so I could post"
"I wish I had something to say so I could post"

#### publishing

I wanted to find a way I could have things on the internet but not be bothered with the bad parts of social media, the metrics and the other parts that make it feel less and less like connecting with people and more like being part of an enormous attention gambling experiment.
This was the exact reason I never managed to really keep up with it. It was too performative. I was doing it for the wrong reasons! I don't mind being performative but it has to be for the right reasons, on a stage that I choose.
Whenever I do start posting regularly It's no surprise that I [burnout](burnout.md) from it quickly whenever I start.
