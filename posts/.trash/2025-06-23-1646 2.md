There's a certain point were it becomes necessary to be seen in different ways. As a tactical supplier of graphic design, it can only take you so far. I have been freelance for so long I don't think I can ever be employed by anyone. Have I gone too feral?

Perhaps it's the tool I'm using. Perhaps the laptop is just bad for this kind of development. Whatever the case, it is time to stop doing this for now. I would like to have had it resolved. I would like to be able to not take this as a personal affront. Sometimes it's hard because while I need to be conscious of pedantry (and meta pedantry) it find it really hard to move forward with things if I have something lodged in my head. I just want to get something working and I have a minimum threshold for this. Developing this site involves a lot of really unpleasant loops. This is because I am coding with the ChatGPT. It doesn't really know what it is doing and this means it can make me do things that do not make sense. I am kind of used to the code not making sense at all. This is perhaps the problem. I refused to learn to code enough of 11ty to have it working myself, and suffer because of this shortcut.
