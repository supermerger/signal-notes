The idea is to simply *be*, to write not with the idea to become anything or show off to anyone. In this way being sure that the right thing to do is simply to write and publish and write and publish until the direction becomes clear.

Contrasting with writing strategically: writing with an aim in mind, with a audience in mind. Would it be painfully obvious when I am trying to sell myself in this way to others? This is what happens on LinkedIn. I am honestly exhausted by the very idea of this. I read somewhere about marketing being like oil in food. If you can see it dripping off, then you have used too much

There's a certain point were it becomes necessary to be seen in different ways. As a tactical supplier of graphic design, it can only take you so far. I have been freelance for so long I don't think I can ever be employed by anyone. Have I gone too feral?
