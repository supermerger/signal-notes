Tension happens when things are pulled or pushed in more than one direction at the same time by a [force](force.md)

A system can be said to be in equilibrium when the forces balance.

Tensions can cause systems to oscillate between extremes. 

A tension can be thought of as a kind of dialogue. 

Forces can either be push or pull forces. 

One of the tensions in freelance life is between validation and autonomy. 




### Tensions

#### Logic and emotion

#### supermerger and Jh
There's definitely a tension between the work I am called to be doing and the work that I get paid for. 
The purple of supermerger and the orange of Jh.


##### Letting a Project Develop vs Staying True to the Vision
aka the growth breaks the frame

##### Making a System vs Rebelling Against Systems
When there is ambiguity I will seek to create a system. This is because although I am a freelancer I do not have a high tolerance for [ambiguity](ambiguity.md) at all.
I create systems to reduce friction and ambiguity. This is because I have actions that I need to perform that I don't get much value from. Perhaps they are just regular tasks, or perhaps they are just not fun.
Therefore I try to offload as much of it as possible into a system that takes less effort. 
The trouble comes from when the system *works*. I can no longer apply [stress test](stress%20test.md)ing. It has passed, and it is now fully sublimated. 

It is interesting to me that I define systems as something that reduces friction and ambiguity. What happens if I flip this around? A system increases fluidity and certainty. Framing it in this way means we are transforming the [force](force.md) from a push force into a pull force. 

I am constantly creating systems then rebelling against the system. 

Inventing a set of rules then feeling bound by them

#####  Autonomy vs Validation
The freelancer tension.
On the one hand you like to have freedom to do what you want and work with who you choose
On the other hand you desire validation that you have done a good job. I prefer validation in the currency of money.
