More pedantry:

Already thinking about how this blog will end. It is inevitable that one day will be the last day that I post. Abandonment is 100% likely. 

Let's look at the ways that the blog will end:
1. Death. The ultimate end.
2. Disillusionment:
	1. The blog fails to generate artefacts
	2. I dodge myself out of it
		1. "It was taking too much of my time/effort"
		2. "oh look a new shiny thing" aka I Get Bored
		3. "here is a well reasoned answer"
3. Transcendance:
	1. I generate sucessful artefacts that make continuing on the blog a waste of effort.

If we look at all the reasons that the blog will end then we can think of solutions for each of them:
1. I can't stop death
2. Stop doing so much meta
	1. Actually write about real things
	2. Keep it varied
	3. Get stupid about writing
3. This is not a problem



There are two kinds of activity that will help produce artefacts:
1. Structured Writing
2. Free form Flow

Each has a place. Structured activity is like a recipe and produces an artefact.




There is meta and there is *meta*
