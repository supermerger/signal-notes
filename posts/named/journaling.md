### the beginning
I remember why I started journaling every day. I wanted to sift through my thoughts and see if any were worth recording. I wanted to write a regular newsletter.

I had a lot of things running around my head, and having a recording practice was helping me to resolve issues. 
I feel that my head is more calm now. 
In this sense the journal keeping was a success. It taught me new tools and introduced a formal writing discipline to my routine. This writing routine sometimes feels rote, but it keeps me honest.

Now I am attempting to strip away some other behaviours I have picked up along the way that are no so useful for actually writing. In the main Obsidian vault there is a lot of overhead. It has its uses as an Obstkiste and task management, but it comes at a cost: it can be easy to get distracted by the complexity. 

Just as now, even though I am trying to keep it to a minimum with a new setup. In order for it to work I will have to be strict.



### the pedant
I got caught up in pendant behaviour. Caught up in the details of it all.
Now I'm thinking to myself that I need to work on the pipeline (more pendandry). Anything that takes away from the actual job and distracts from the really hard work of getting the right words on the page in the right order. That coal face labour can not really be substituted. The trouble is always distribution. How to get it out into the world. This is secondary to having anyone to read it. That's not something that concerns me. It's more about externalising things. Patterns will form in time. It's about intentionality. Doing things by hand with intention. Already though I feel as though it is something doomed. I can only say that at some point, for some reason this archive will be forever abandoned. I don't know when that will be. This could be the first and only post. 

I want to number things differently. I used to use a leading set of zeros to mark things. I do this as part of my commercial practice. But for these I think I will just use the numbers as they are.
