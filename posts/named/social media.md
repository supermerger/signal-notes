All social media is attention seeking.
All publishing is attention seeking.

There is nothing really wrong with this. In a lot of people there is a need for both validation and autonomy. Like many [[tension]]s

The reasons I wanted to have a blog were to attract attention to myself. This was the exact reason I never managed to really keep up with it. It was too performative. I was doing it for the wrong reasons! 
It's no surprise that I burn out from it quickly whenever I start. 

Burning out from something has nothing to do with the amount of work. It is more influenced by your alignment to the work. Burn out itself is something to be treated as inevitable. The idea behind many of the systems that I build are to mitigate this.

Explicitly then the purpose of this blog is to create [artefacts](artefacts.md) that generate attention and reputation for me. It's an attempt to do this in a way that does not drive me crazy
