Coherence is resolved [ambiguity](ambiguity.md).  It's not quite the same thing as order.

Order is different because it is predictable. Order is a machine. Coherence incorporates chaotic elements and is a general view of the state of things. 

Coherence is built by looking at the edges of ambiguity 

I feel like I want things to make sense.
