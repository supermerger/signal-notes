Ambiguity is a superposition. There are many possible states for it to be resolved.

It is not the same thing as chaos, although I don't know enough about chaos to be really sure about this.

Ambiguity is resolved by:
- making decisions about things
- time - this is the part that confuses me. Because if situations can resolve themselves over time then in some cases entropy could be said to be reducing over time.
- logic: if A then B. B is resolved.

When ambiguity is resolved it becomes [density](density.md)

A designer resolves a certain type of ambiguity. Lawyers also resolve a particular type of ambiguity.
