I want to be free of pedantry. I read the definition of pedantry and it chilled me

> _the quality of being too interested in formal rules and small details that are not important_
> 
> [Cambridge Dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/pedantry)

I feel like I value minimalism and yet it is possible to be a pedant about this more than anything. If only a few things, then *which* few things and *why*.

Pedantry has value in the world of design. Pedantry is a form of chest beating, and a demand for territory. It's used to police the "in" and "out" groups. 

Sometimes I joke with clients and call non designers "civilians" as in: "Don't worry about it, it's not a civilian problem"

There is meta and there is *meta*. 
Trying to fix pedantry is meta-pedantry. It's replacing correctness with non-correctness. Ego maintenance. 
Meta pedantry is being pedantic about pedantry itself. More self-policing, but the focus is different, a meta target instead of a real one. Same great taste, but all new packaging.
