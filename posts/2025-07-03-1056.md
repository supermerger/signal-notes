Having the publishing blog working introduces the knife of intention to posting and writing. I feel like I should be sharp. It feels like I am committing more to the world. There is a shard of fear in me that burns somehow green and blue and red. I feel like the knife cuts like the edges of a container. Work is either inside or outside. Work is either seen or not seen. I'm looking at the solid parts that I know about this problem, but where does the knife fall, and what is excised? This is a problem both for now and for later.

There is a [stress test](stress%20test.md) or filtering process that must happen. 
Does it happen in an ad hoc way? Yes, I believe I should be free to post whatever I like. I think that there should be no 'works in progress' and as few drafts as possible.
In fact I might just trash all the drafts and even the draft rule. In or out. Publish or die.
