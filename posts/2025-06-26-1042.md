I feel a need to start something now, like I need to get my teeth into something new. This is the part where you have to get the words on the page and keep writing until there is nothing left (there is always something left).

The work you are avoiding is in more structured writing. This is a kind of direction you should use. Think of moulds to shape your thought. If you want to have an object then you need to pour your thoughts into it and let it set

What are the fiction pieces that you could write?
- The Slime Story aka To The Top
this is the first one you thought of, so it must be the first one that you want to do right now. 
Don't bother with the others for the moment.

I made these:
[to the top](to%20the%20top.md)
[world building](world%20building.md)
