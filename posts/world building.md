World building is a process of building up [coherence](coherence.md) with a set of facts, then introducing them in interesting ways. Show, don't tell.

### Just the facts
In world building note only write FACTS.
no questions. questions are noise.

#### ambient facts
Facts about the world around the character that does not directly effect the plot

#### story facts
A series of facts that advances the plot

### Resolving [ambiguity](ambiguity.md)
audit facts by writing options
how many things can you think of?
- option A
- option B
- ...
which of these routes is the best

Once there is a level of coherence that reaches [critical mass](critical%20mass.md) then it is time to think about characters and groups that haunt that place.

Resist attempting total coherence.
This is [pedantry](pedantry.md).

### Why do this?

Why not work in the world you are in now?
It's often in times when things are most confusing and difficult that I find myself retreating into speculative worldbuilding.

This is because I value coherence, and I wish to reduce the ambiguity in my life by inventing somewhere that I understand.
