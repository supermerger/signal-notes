### world building
Think of the world that you want to create. 
Then imagine characters haunting that place.

You value coherence. If a world is not coherent then it cannot be inhabited.
You cannot have 100% coherence. There must be some part of it that does not make total sense to you.

Once you have a level of [coherence](coherence) that reaches [critical mass](critical%20mass.md) then perhaps it is time to start thinking about the events and characters that make up the plot.

World building is a process of building up a set of facts, then introducing them in interesting ways. Show, don't tell.
