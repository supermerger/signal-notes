### Don't throw yourself into a new project straight away.

Ambiguity between spaces is a good place, it's a place for rotting. Break down the ideas and the concepts of the old. Break them into little pieces and re-assemble everything. Discover yourself as a writer. You are the one that writes, not the one that reads. In time, the imagination and motivation will find you. Concentrate instead on building the habits of a writer. Mainly this means training your brain and your fingers and everything else to become a straight pipe from the brain to the page. Something that happens at the speed of thought. This will make the later stages of actually finishing something much easier. 

Especially don't throw yourself into projects that have an aesthetic idea but no real container. I am using aesthetic here in a more formal sense. When something has formal aspect of conception but no container it is a dangerous place for procrastination and pedantry. The inspiration for the aesthetic could be 'red car' but without a container then it just goes on being an unresolved aesthetic.

In this between states it's perfectly possible to get caught up developing tools and things that don't matter to anyone. Solving pedantic problems of no use to anyone. I spent a lot of time doing this with shaders. I spent a long time working on a shader that isn't really even that useful, and isn't even that complicated in the end. 

Once I have worked out the tool then it no longer interests me. This happened with the 'black and white image maker'. I recently solved this and can now make these perfectly looping images at will. I spent a long time perfecting this pipeline, only to abandon it when it is capable of carrying work.

It is so hard to do anything visual. I find it hard to maintain interest in the work if it does not have a concept. Just 'making something cool' is not something I can be bothered with anymore. I find myself second guessing the project. Mostly it goes nowhere. It's so half-arsed. 
That's not to say that I don't do things just for the sake of doing them. I do this often
